## NOTE: This file is not used - it is here to trick catkin into thinking it
## should install a Miro-extras.cmake file. What we actually install is 
## a modified Miro-extras.cmake.develspace.in which has the install 
## destination for MIRO_MAKEPARAMS_EXECUTABLE.
## Prior to installing, the file is stored in develspace as
## devel/share/Miro/cmake/Miro-extras.cmake-install
