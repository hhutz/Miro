NotifyMulticastTest
===================

Tool for basic notify multicast adapter testing.

Not of general interest, but maybe useful to get familiar with this
service.

Starts up a notification service, creates a consumer and a NotifyMulticast
adapter and tries to subscribe for different domain-types-pairs passed
by parameters


MulticastAdapter
================

Stand alone version of the multicast module.

The scenario is the following: Two computers run their own local event channel 
and use a different naming context. Start a MulticastAdapter on each computer with 
the local naming context. If you now start a consumer such as GenericNotify with 
the local naming context and an event name/type name pair this event should 
be forwarded through the multicast group from the remote server to the local 
event channel.

A hand crafted setup for testing:

I assume we have two computers A & B running in the same subnet
(multicast routing is something your local network guru should
configure for you, if it is really required). These computers have
access to some naming service (might be one shared or two local ones,
we don't care).

Start a notification service, a event publisher and a multicast
adapter on computer A. The first two are contained by the NotifyTest:

cd $MIRO_BIN
./NotifyTest -MNC A -colocated

-MNC (MiroNamingContext) selects the naming context. -colocated tells
the test to create its own notification service and event channel. The
test allows to send three different types of events through the
channel. You can subscribe to these events directly at the local event
channel. You can test it with GenericNotify:

./GenericNotify Sonar A -MNC A

The command line parameters tell GenericNotify to subscribe for events
with the type_name "Sonar" and domain_name "A" at the event channel
that is registered at the naming service in the naming context (MNC)
"A".

If the local setup works, we can test the actual event channel
federations. First we start a MulticastAdapter on computer A:

cd $MIRO_ROOT/bin
./MulticastAdapter -MNC A

(You can enhance the verbosity of the adapter by specifying the log level and the log filter
at the command line: -MiroLogLevel 9 -MiroLogFilter NMC)


Now we start up the same programs on computer B, using the apropriate
naming context etc. Note that we still want to subscribe for the sonar events of computer A:

cd $MIRO_ROOT/bin
./NotifyTest -MNC B -colocated
./MulticastAdapter -MNC B
./GenericNotify Sonar A -MNC B

Additional GenericNotify instances can be started on both computers to
report on other events. Also, you can verify that the events are
exchanged through the multicast group, by simple stopping one of the
multicast adapters. Restarting them should reestablish the
connection. Note that the multicast adapter considers timeouts for
events. So either synchronize the clocks of the two computers (NTP),
or set the timeout parameter to zero in the configuration file.
