We are pleased to announce our next snapshot of Miro.

It is the third beta. The tag in the cvs repository is
Beta3. You can update to it by a simple:

cvs update -r Beta3

Tar archives and the manual are also available at our web site.

There is lots of new stuff in the current Miro cvs since the last 
Miro-Ppb-Beta: 

- Lots of small fixes for the new gcc 3.x versions. Miro should now
compile with the current gcc versions without any problems.

- Some fixes for the latest ACE/TAO versions. Miro should now compile
with current ACE/TAO versions. However, we did not test it extensively
on the robots.

- Support for out new Sparrow2003 robot platform.

- A new VideoService, adding support for firewire digital cameras and
providing an infrastructur for advanced image filtering. It is now
covered by a seperate chapter in the documentation. Unluckily this
changes the Video interface sligthly.

- Autoconf and Automake support. This is also covered in the manual.
