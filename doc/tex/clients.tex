\chapter{Test and Example Programs}
\label{sec:clients}

The \miro repository comes with different kinds of test and
example programs that are scattered over four different directories:

\begin{description}
\item[examples]
  These programs show the easiest way of using a
  specific service. In most cases it's just getting data and printing
  it to {\tt cout}.
\item[utils] These are programs designed to fasciliate the handling of
  your mobile robots. For example, programs located in this directory
  provide a graphical view of the services output or state.
\item[tests]
  These programs are designed to reliably
  test an entire interface. They often come with a simple character
  dialog and the possible selections rely directly to the interfaces
  as described in the auto-generated online help.
\item[performance-tests]
  They measure the performance of individual
  sensory or actuatory devices. Mostly the throughput.
