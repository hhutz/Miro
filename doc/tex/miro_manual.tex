\chapter{Introduction}

\miro is a distributed object oriented framework for mobile robot
control, based on CORBA (Common Object Request Broker
Architecture) \cite{OMG:CORBA-standart} technology. The \miro core
components have been developed in C++ for Linux. But due to the
programming language independency of CORBA further components can be
written in any language and on any platform that provides CORBA
implementations.

The \miro core components have been developed under the aid of ACE
(Adaptive Communications Environment) \cite{ACE-Paper, ACE-Manual}, an
object oriented multi-platform framework for OS-independent
interprocess, network and real time communication. They use TAO (The
ACE ORB) \cite{TAO-paper} as their ORB (Object Request Broker), a
CORBA implementation designed for high performance and real time
applications. Therefore \miro should be easily portable to any other
OS, where ACE and TAO run on.  These are many Unix clones, Windows NT
and some real time operating systems.

\miro is currently available for the RWI B21 platform (pre rflex), the
Activmedia Pioneer family (namely the Performance PeopleBot), and the
vi\sparrow architecture developed at the University of Ulm.  We are
convinced, that other ports can be done straight forward.

\miro was built since the existing robot control architectures didn't
suffice our needs of usability, reliability, scalability and
portability.

We used C++ due to its advantages in big projects, since it was
especially designed for big projects. We have learned the hard way,
that this is a serious requirement, for projects like a mobile robot
control architecture.

We use multi processing, multithreading and the CORBA technology since
most robotics applications are inherently concurrent and distributed.
The hardware devices, like sensors and actuators run concurrently and
due to the constant lack of computing power especially in computer
vision, tend to reside on multiple computers. And as soon as
cooperative behavior of multiple autonomous robots is of interest, the
system as a whole is distributed anyways.

%We used an object oriented approach, since real live objects are
%concerned. And on the other hand, OO is just state of the art and you
%need good arguments to start a new project ignoring object
%orientation.

And last but not least we use ACE and TAO since these are multi
platform, high performance libraries which proved to be very
sophisticated in terms of usability, portability and scalability. ---
Additionally, they are open source libraries. They haven't
disappointed us yet, to the contrary.

\section{The \miro Group}

The \miro core developers are (in alphabetical order):
\begin{itemize}
  \item Stefan Enderle
  \item Gerhard Kraetzschmar
  \item Gerd Mayer
  \item Guillem Pages
  \item Stefan Sablatn\"og
  \item Steffen Simon
  \item Hans Utz
\end{itemize}

\section{\miro Directory Structure}

\miro comes with the full source code and documentation as well as a
set of test programs and examples that should facilitate your first
steps when writing your own programs. To help you navigate through the
directory tree of a \miro distribution, we give a brief overview of
the directories present in the \miro root directory:

\begin{description}
\item[bin:]
  This directory contains links to the binaries of \miro.
  For an explanation of the individual binaries, see Chapter
  \ref{sec:services} about the robot services.
\item[botsvcs:] Higher level robot services. This is were platform
  independent stuff for autonomous mobile robot programming should go.
  Currently it hosts a framework for hierarchical behavior programming
  and one for particle filter based Monte Carlo self localization.
\item[doc:]
  Here, the available documentation is gathered. In the
  subdirectory {\tt tex} you find the postscript version of this
  manual and in the directory {\tt html} resides the auto generated
  online documentation of all \miro classes and their methods
  (the starting page of this documentation resides at: \\
  {\tt \$MIRO\_ROOT/doc/html/idl/index.html} respectively \\
  {\tt \$MIRO\_ROOT/doc/html/cpp/index.html}).
\item[etc:] Config files for the individual robots. While these are
  xml-based configuration files, using the {\tt ConfigEditor} will
  surely facilitate their editing.
\item[examples:]
  Examples on how to use individual interfaces of \miro. If you want
  to write your own programs utilizing the \miro framework, this is a
  good place to look for inspirations.
\item[idl:]
  The IDL sources of the CORBA interfaces and data types.
\item[performance-tests:]
  Some tests that measure the performance of \miro's
  services. --- Not too much there at the moment.
\item[scripts:]
  Utilities for source code formatting and handling sequences of
  datafiles.
\item[src:]
  Here, all sources of the \miro services reside. New services for
  further robot platforms should go in here.
\item[templates:]
  Templates for Makefiles and the headers for source files. Copy the
  corresponding template, if you want to start a new subproject within
  the \miro source hierarchy. If you start your own new project on top
  of \miro, the Makefile templates might still be useful for you. They
  handle all the stuff concerning ACE/TAO and the multi-platform build
  process. See Chapter \ref{sec:makefile} for details.
\item[tests:]
  Small test programs to monitor or test isolated interfaces of the
  \miro robot control architecture.
\item[utils:]
  Utilities made for convenience. No magic to be expected here, but some
  really cool graphical editing facilities.
